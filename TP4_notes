Qust 2.1
The peruvian schedule might make sure to arrive first, then every time the bolivian 
driver is sleeping a new peruvian driver arrives and drops the pebble in the bowl.


Qust 2.2

// Shared variable
int check = 0 ;

void enter_cs(){
	while ( check != 0 ){
		sleep( rand() % 10 ); // We don't know the sleeping time
	}
	check = 1 ;
	// Execution
	// Access cs
	}

}

void leave_cs(){
	check = 0 ;
}

int main(){
	// Enter CS
	enter_cs() ;
	// execution in sc
	leave_cs()
	
	return 0 ;
}


Qust 2.3

The problem was never observed, it is so inprobable for another train to arrive 
every single time at during the sleeping stage of the other driver. It may happen
several times, but this occuring forever has a very low proba of happening
